EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
====================

EXPERIMENT OVERVIEW
-------------------
Dataset: Amazon Reviews (5-class rating prediction)
Models tested: ~30 baseline models + MainModel
Analysis components: Baseline, Hyperparameter, Cross-validation, Interpretability, Ablation, Robustness

KEY FINDINGS
------------
• Comprehensive evaluation across multiple model categories
• MainModel achieved competitive performance with ensemble methods
• Cross-validation showed stable performance across folds
• Multimodal approach provides benefits over single modality
• Models demonstrate reasonable robustness to noise and perturbations

RECOMMENDATIONS
---------------
• Consider ensemble methods for production deployment
• Multimodal fusion recommended for best performance
• Regular retraining recommended to maintain performance
• Monitor model performance under distribution shift
