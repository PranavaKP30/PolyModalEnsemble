Project Goal/Description:

Question:
How can a modality-aware adaptive bagging ensemble—integrating strategic modality dropout, adaptive base learner selection, and transformer-based dynamic fusion—improve predictive accuracy, robustness to missing modalities, and interpretability in multimodal learning tasks compared to conventional fusion and ensemble methods?

Hypothesis:
We hypothesize that the proposed Modality-Aware Adaptive Bagging Ensemble will:
1. Performance Gains – Achieve statistically significant improvements in predictive accuracy, F1-score, and AUROC over traditional early fusion, late fusion, and unimodal baselines, with the performance advantage increasing as the number and diversity of modalities grows.
2. Robustness – Maintain higher accuracy and lower performance degradation than baselines under simulated missing modality conditions due to strategic modality dropout during training.
3. Interpretability – Provide more actionable modality importance and learner confidence insights than existing multimodal fusion methods through attention-based meta-learning and integrated uncertainty estimation.
4. Scalability – Deliver these benefits without prohibitive computational overhead by leveraging adaptive learner selection and modular architecture design.
5. Novel Feature Impact – Each novel architectural component (modality-aware dropout bagging, adaptive base learner selection, cross-modal denoising auxiliary tasks, and transformer-based meta-learner) will contribute measurable performance improvements, with ablation studies demonstrating statistically significant degradation when any component is removed.
